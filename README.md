# Seasonal recurrence and modular assembly of an Arctic pelagic marine microbiome

This repository contains a detailed description, as well as the respective scripts to recreate the bioinformatic and statistical analysis that was used to analyse the 2016 - 2020 West Spitsbergen Current time-series data, which includes both SSU rRNA gene amplicons and PacBio HiFI metagenomes.

The repository aims to support the following manuscript:

For a background on the dataset, please refer to the methodology section of the manuscript.
